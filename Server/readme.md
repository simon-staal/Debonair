Notes
=====
Starting to work on building the backend server in node.js.
To run the server, simply run `node index.js` (make sure node is up to date).
To then test the server functionality, in another terminal you can use `curl localhost:8080` (in this particular case we are using port 8080)

Going to try to run server in AWS instance and see if I can connect from local PC.
